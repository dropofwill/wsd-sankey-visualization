Sankey Diagram of Rule Distributions in a Decision List Algorithm Applied to the Word Sense Disambiguation Problem
========================

A Sankey-like diagram of the results of my implementation of the decision list algorithm applied to the WSD problem.

See PS1 of [dropofwill/word-sense-disambiguation](https://github.com/dropofwill/word-sense-disambiguation/blob/master/ps2_1_dlclassifier.py) for where the data came from.

Uses the D3 Sankey layout plugin, which [can be found here](https://github.com/d3/d3-plugins/tree/master/sankey).

For my Natural Language Processing class we recently approached the problem of Word Sense Disambiguation from a machine learning perspective (among others, including lookup approaches like Lesk), using the simple, but quite effective, decision list algorithm.

Concept:

• Quickly explain the Word Sense Disambiguation problem

• And the Decision List approach

• Introduce confusion matrix, but this is missing the pipeline aspect of the approach

• In comes some sort of hierarchal flow that shows how the rules progress through "time"

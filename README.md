Sankey Diagram of Rule Distributions in a Decision List Algorithm Applied to the Word Sense Disambiguation Problem
========================

A Sankey-like diagram of the results of my implementation of the decision list algorithm applied to the WSD problem.

See decision list of [dropofwill/word-sense-disambiguation](https://github.com/dropofwill/word-sense-disambiguation/) for where the data came from.

Uses the D3 Sankey layout plugin, which [can be found here](https://github.com/d3/d3-plugins/tree/master/sankey).

For my Natural Language Processing class we recently approached the problem of Word Sense Disambiguation from a machine learning perspective (among others, including lookup approaches like Lesk), using the simple, but quite effective, decision list algorithm.
